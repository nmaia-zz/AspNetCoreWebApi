# AspNetCoreWebApi
A sample project using Asp Net Core 2.1 WebApi and EF Core.

## Testing the project

- I've setup swagger in order to deliver a friendly way to test the project. When you run it, the index page of the API is the swagger documentation.

- But if you want to use postman to test the project, you must turn off the SSL certificate validation in the postman settings section.
